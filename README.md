# Artificial-Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
In this repository you can find 3 real world applications of deep learnings techniques. Those have been developed as project for the deep learning course at Politecnico di Milano and are:
* image classification to detect if people are wearing face mask correctly
* image segmentation to localize where in fields different types of plants are present
* visual question answering to correctly answer a question paired with an image providing information. 


Me and my team performed top 5% in the first two challenges and we were awarded with maximum marks.
Reports and codes are provided.
