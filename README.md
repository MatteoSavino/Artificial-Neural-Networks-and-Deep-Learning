# Artificial-Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
Deep learning is the most innovative and best performing technique to deal with images and text data. In this repository 3 real world applications are shown, developed as project for the deep learning course at Politecnico di Milano: image classification to detect if people are wearing face mask correctly, image segmentation to localize where in fields different types of plants are present, visual question answering to correctly answer a question paired with an image providing information. Me and my team performed top 5% in the first two challenges and we were awarded with maximum marks. Reports and codes are provided.
